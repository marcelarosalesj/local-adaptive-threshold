# Local Adaptive Threshold  

Here I implement a Local Adaptive Threshold to understand better the histogram of an image.  

Also, I want to pre-process the image so I can get its text using Tesseract.  

* I've been using this parameters and they work. I still have to check with other configurations and use it in the adaptivethresholding.cpp. Or create a new project.
